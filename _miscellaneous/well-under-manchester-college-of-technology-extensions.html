<p>A well was discovered here while extensions to the Manchester College of Technology (now the University of Manchester’s Sackville Street building) were being built.</p>

    Work began in 1938 and in early 1939 an unexpected discovery on the site was pictured in another newspaper report - an old well several hundred feet deep. The site of the well is identifiable as a pump to the immediate east of St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Chapel on the very finely detailed 1848 Ordnance Survey map - even the interior of the chapel is shown!

    Several hundred feet deep, this old well has been discovered on the site of the Manchester College of Technology extensions. It is believed that the well was originally one of the city’s main sources of water supply.
