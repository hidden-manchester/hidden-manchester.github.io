<p>{{page.description}}</p>

<p>The Tib rises from a spring named Coopers Pit in Miles Platting and broadly runs towards the top of Tib St, down its length, through the old Lewis’s (now Primark) arcade, under the town hall extension, the library and The Midland, down to Tib Lock and then under First St to where it <a href="tib-draining-into-the-medlock.html" target="_blank">drains into the Medlock</a>.</p>

<p>It has been culverted for around two centuries now, and is often just a dry ditch (as was often the case except in times of heavy rain). It did once feed Shude-Hill Pits and the Infirmary pond—two reservoirs supplying the city with water.</p>

<p>There is an interesting connection with the Rochdale Canal, which has a lock named after it at the point their courses cross: a <a href=/waterways/river-tib-canal-drain.html>trap door</a> can drain the canal into the river.</p>

<p>The river is also mentioned in Geoffrey Ashworth’s 1987 book <cite><a href=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Rivers-Manchester-Geoffrey-Ashworth/dp/0946361126 target=_blank>The Lost Rivers of Manchester</a></cite> where its overall route can be seen, as well as in <cite><a href=/sources.html#underground-manchester--below-manchester>Underground Manchester</a></cite> (although I think it shows the river about 100ft too far east). Its route from Peter Street to the River Medlock is shown in on <a href=http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps2~1~1~340688~123190:Manchester-and-Salford?sort=Reference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CPage&qvq=q:william%2Bgreen%2Bmap;sort:Reference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CReference_Number%2CPage;lc:maps2~1~1,Manchester~91~1,ManchesterDev~95~2,Man4MedievalVC~4~4,nonconform~91~1,ManchesterDev~93~3,lib1~1~1&mi=0&trs=1# target=_blank>William Green’s 1794 map</a>.

  <p>The lower portion of the river can be seen on <a href=http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps002~1~1~340688~123190 target=_blank>William Green’s 1794 ‘Plan of Manchester & Salford’</a>.</p>
