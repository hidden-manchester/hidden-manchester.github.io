Shooters Brook rises in Newton Heath. It is a tributary of the Medlock and is fed by <a href={{site.github.url}}/waterways/newton-brook.html>Newton Brook</a>. Although these days it is diverted into the <a href={{site.github.url}}/waterways/dukes-tunnel.html>Dukes Tunnel</a> and sewers it used to run openly through Manchester from the North East, meeting the Medlock at <a href=http://manchesterhistory.net/manchester/tours/tour9/area9page38.html target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Garrat Hall</a>.
