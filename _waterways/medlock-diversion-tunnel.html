<p>Here the Medlock is diverted via a siphon underneath the Bridgewater canal. Before this tunnel was built the river supplied the Bridgewater, but this was no longer necessary when the connection to the Rochdale Canals was made. The pins on the map represent ventilation grids. The tunnel and associated overflow are <a href=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1283003 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>grade II listed structures</a>.</p>

<p>You can see the route of this tunnel in <a href=https://luna.manchester.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps002~1~1~340213~123169 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Adshead’s illustrated map of St John’s Ward</a> from 1851. Slightly further downstream the Bridgewater canal overflows through <a href="remains-of-brindley-s-cloverleaf-weir-on-potato-wharf.html">a weir named Giant’s Basin at Potato Wharf</a> into the Medlock. There is a great bit of history for this stretch of the Medlock on <a href=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/River_Medlock target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Grace’s Guide to British Industrial History</a>. I’m not sure exactly when the tunnel was completed, but if this passage by James Brindley refers to this work then that would place it around 1764. The canal itself reached Castlefield Wharf from Worsley by 1965 according to the <a href=http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/history/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Bridgewater Canal history page</a>.</p>

<p>There is a great 1936 picture of the <a href=http://images.manchester.gov.uk/web/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=49100&reftable=ecatalogue&refirn=60766 target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>Knott Mill weir (complete with some chaps looking proud of themselves) from the Manchester Archives</a>.

<p>In April 2016 the culvert was surveyed by Geoterra, who used a combination of laser scanning and sonar to map the section of the culvert which crosses Chester Road to support a Peel Holdings development in the area. Their <a href=http://www.geoterra.co.uk/cases/chester-road/ target=_blank rel='noopener noreferrer'>page about the project</a> has some fascinating renderings of the 3D model they produced, showing the general shape of the tunnel.</p>
