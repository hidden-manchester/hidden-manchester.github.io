title: "Medlock Diversion Tunnel"
description: "<p>Here the Medlock is diverted via a siphon underneath the Bridgewater canal. Before this tunnel was built the river supplied the Bridgewater, but this was no longer necessary when the connection to the Rochdale Canals was made. The pins on the map represent ventilation grids. The tunnel and associated overflow are <a href=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1283003 target=_blank>grade II listed structures</a>.</p>"

<p>You can see the route of this tunnel in <a href=http://enriqueta.man.ac.uk/luna/servlet/detail/maps002~1~1~340213~123169 target=_blank>Adshead’s illustrated map of St John’s Ward</a> from 1851. Slightly further downstream the Bridgewater canal overflows through <a href="remains-of-brindley-s-cloverleaf-weir-on-potato-wharf.html">a weir named Giant’s Basin at Potato Wharf</a> into the Medlock. There is a great bit of history for this stretch of the Medlock on <a href=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/River_Medlock target=_blank>Grace’s Guide to British Industrial History</a>. I’m not sure exactly when the tunnel was completed, but if this passage by James Brindley refers to this work then that would place it around 1764. The canal itself reached Castlefield Wharf from Worsley by 1965 according to the <a href=http://www.bridgewatercanal.co.uk/history/ target=_blank>Bridgewater Canal history page</a>.</p>
